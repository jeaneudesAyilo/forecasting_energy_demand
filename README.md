# Forecasting hourly energy demand in Spain - Advanced methods in Big Data Project

Forecasting energy demand is an important task in electric power industry. This study aims to forecast in advance at each day, the 24 hours of the electrical energy consumption of the next day in Spain, so we are in the context of multistep time series forecasting. To do so, explanatory variables such as the electricity price and the weather were used. To take into account the problems related to dimensionality and multicollinearity, we performed Ridge regression, LASSO and regression based on Factorial Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD). In addition, machine learning and deep learning models were used to reach our goal. Apart from the deep learning models, the remaining models were evaluated using Walk Forward Validation (WFV) instead of Cross Validation. Among our model, we fund that Convolutional Neural
Network and the Random forest with multiple output give better results so future work could combine both, but their RMSE (Root Mean square Error) were very far from the one of European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE) that we took as reference. Limits of this work have been discussed and some solutions have been proposed.

Key words : Energy demand, Multi-step time series forecasting, Walk Forward Validation.
